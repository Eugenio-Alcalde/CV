<h3>CAREER HISTORY</h3>
<p><b>Research Associate</b> (2105-present) School of Biological Science, Royal Holloway, University of London (UK). Supervisor: Prof Dr Paul D. Fraser. Production of high-value Carotenoids in Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. Academic and industrial project focus on the development of new strains and their adaptation to an industrial scale production, combining Genetics and Molecular Biology with Analytical Techniques.

__ __Postdoctoral student__ __ (2014-2015) Department of Genética, University of Sevilla (Spain). Supervisor: Prof Dr Paul D Fraser. Study of the molecular basis of the carotenoids regulation of Phycomyces in different mutant strains and the effects across the metabolism.

**PhD student** (2009-2013) Department of Genética, University of Sevilla (Spain). Supervisor: Prof Dr Enrique Cerdá Olmedo. Identification and characterization of the apocarotenoids involved in the sexual interaction in mucorales fungi Phycomyces Blakesleeanus, Blakeslea trispora and Mucor circinelloides and their implication in the regulation of the biosynthetic pathway of carotenoids.

**Short visits to other research institutions**
November 2016 - Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry (Halle, Germany). Supervisor: Dr Sylvestre Marillonnet. Training in New Molecular Cloning Systems (Moclo / Golden Gate) and CRISPR-Cas9.

January-April 2011 - Department of Cell Biology of the University Albert Ludwigs (Freiburg, Germany). Supervisor: Dr Salim Al-Babili. Identification and characterization by Expression and analysis in vivo and in vitro in E. coli of the oxygenases from Mucor circinelloides responsible for the apocarotenoids production.

September-December 2010 - Department of Division of Cell Biology and Biophysics, School of Biological Sciences, University of Missouri-Kansas City (Kansas City, U.S.A.). Supervisor: Dr Alexander Idnurm. Genome mapping (PCR-RFLPs markers) in Phycomyces blakesleeanus to identify the unknown genes responsible for the phenotype of the carotenoid producer mutants.

July 2009 - Department of Genética y Microbiología, University of Murcia (Murcia, Spain). Supervisor: Prof Dr Victoriano Garre. Transformation of Mucor circinelloides to knockout one candidate gene to be responsible for the apocarotenoid metabolism.
